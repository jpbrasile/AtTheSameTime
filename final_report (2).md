# Cold Atmospheric Plasma Pasteurization of Milk: Efficiency, Yield, and Comparative Analysis

**Introduction**

In an era defined by increasing consumer consciousness regarding food processing, the demand for natural, minimally processed, yet safe and nutritious food options is surging [1]. Traditional thermal pasteurization, while effectively ensuring microbial safety and extending shelf life, can compromise milk quality through protein denaturation, vitamin loss, and flavor alterations [2, 3].  Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) technology has emerged as a promising non-thermal alternative, offering the potential to pasteurize milk while preserving its inherent quality attributes [1, 4]. This report delves into the application of CAP, specifically plasma bubbling, for milk pasteurization, evaluating its efficiency, yield, and comparative advantages and disadvantages against conventional methods.

**Process Description of Cold Atmospheric Plasma Pasteurization**

Cold atmospheric plasma is a partially ionized gas characterized by non-equilibrium conditions, where reactive species are generated at approximately room temperature [5].  This is achieved through cascade reactions initiated by energetic electrons colliding with neutral gas molecules, producing a cocktail of antimicrobial agents including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), UV light, ions, and electrons [6, 7]. These reactive components, particularly ROS, are instrumental in microbial inactivation [6, 7].

Several configurations exist for CAP generation, including plasma jets, dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs), corona discharges, and microwave discharges [5]. For milk treatment, DBD and corona discharges are commonly employed [5].  Furthermore, CAP can be applied directly or indirectly [8]. Direct methods involve the plasma interacting directly with the milk, while indirect methods, such as plasma bubbling, generate plasma remotely and introduce longer-living reactive species like ozone and nitric oxide into the milk, minimizing heat transfer and preserving heat-sensitive components [8, 9].  Plasma bubbling systems typically utilize a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma source where air is pumped through an encapsulated discharge zone, converting atmospheric gas into free radicals, which are then bubbled through the milk sample [10, 11].

The effectiveness of CAP treatment is influenced by a multitude of factors, including device geometry, electrode design, pressure, voltage, treatment time, exposure mode, humidity, electrode distance, working gas, and sample volume [12, 13]. Optimizing these parameters is critical to achieving effective pasteurization while minimizing undesirable quality changes such as lipid peroxidation [13, 14].

**Efficiency and Yield of Cold Atmospheric Plasma Pasteurization**

**Microbial Decontamination:**

Studies demonstrate the significant efficacy of CAP in microbial reduction in milk. Plasma bubbling treatment for 15 minutes at 200V and 10 L/h airflow has been shown to reduce coliform and yeast counts in raw cow milk to undetectable levels [1, 15].  Specifically, coliform and yeast counts, initially at 6.38±0.002 and 4.42±0.002 log CFU/mL respectively in control samples, were eliminated to undetectable levels after a 15-minute plasma bubbling treatment [1, 16]. This reduction surpasses acceptable limits for coliforms in milk (0-1000/mL) according to established standards [17, 18].

**Shelf Life Extension:**

CAP treatment significantly extends the shelf life of raw cow milk. Control milk typically spoils within 3 days, while plasma-bubbled milk can remain unspoiled for considerably longer durations [19]. A 15-minute plasma bubbling treatment (M3) extended shelf life to 35 days, a substantial increase compared to the 3-day shelf life of untreated milk [19, 20].  Shorter treatment times also provide notable shelf life extension, with 5-minute (M1) and 10-minute (M2) treatments resulting in shelf lives of 14 and 28 days respectively [20]. The extended shelf life is attributed to the sustained antimicrobial activity of hydrogen peroxide produced by cold plasma, which remains stable at refrigeration temperatures [21].

**Physicochemical Properties:**

CAP treatment can induce subtle changes in the physicochemical properties of milk. Plasma bubbling for 15 minutes has been shown to increase milk pH from a control value of 6.66 ± 0.015 to 6.85 ± 0.01 [22, 23]. Conversely, titratable acidity (TA) and total soluble solids (TSS) tend to decrease.  A 15-minute treatment reduced TSS from 10.4±0.003 °Brix to 8±0.001 °Brix and TA from 0.144±0.002 % lactic acid to 0.121±0.002 % lactic acid [24, 25].  Viscosity may exhibit a negligible initial decrease but generally remains stable during extended refrigerated storage [26, 27].  However, viscosity increase is observed upon spoilage [27]. Color changes, measured as total color difference (ΔE), can range from non-noticeable to slightly noticeable depending on treatment parameters [28, 29].

| :------------------------- | :----------------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| pH                         | 6.66 ± 0.015       | 6.85 ± 0.01                  | Decreased             |
| Titratable Acidity (% LA)  | 0.144 ± 0.002      | 0.121 ± 0.002                | 0.15 ± 0.002          |
| Total Soluble Solids (°Brix) | 10.4 ± 0.003      | 8 ± 0.001                    | 10.1 ± 0.001          |

**Nutritional Properties:**

A significant advantage of CAP pasteurization is its minimal impact on the nutritional content of milk. Studies indicate that plasma bubbling treatment does not significantly alter protein and fat content compared to control milk [30, 31]. In contrast, traditional boiling can lead to a decrease in protein content [32]. This preservation of nutritional components positions CAP as a favorable method for maintaining the inherent nutritional value of milk during pasteurization.

| Nutritional Property | Control Milk (Raw) | Plasma Bubbled Milk (15 min) | Boiled Milk (10 min) |
| :------------------- | :----------------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| Protein Content (%)  | 3.41 ± 0.001       | 3.39 ± 0.002                 | Decreased             |
| Fat Content (%)      | 3.52 ± 0.001       | 3.49 ± 0.001                 | Negligibly Increased  |

**Comparison with Alternative Solutions**

Compared to traditional thermal pasteurization methods like High-Temperature Short-Time (HTST) and Ultra-High Temperature (UHT) processing, CAP offers distinct advantages in terms of quality preservation. Thermal methods, while effective for microbial inactivation, can lead to undesirable changes in milk quality, including protein denaturation, non-enzymatic browning, vitamin loss, and alterations in flavor and colloidal properties [2, 3, 33]. Boiling milk, a common household practice, also demonstrates detrimental effects, including decreased pH, increased titratable acidity, and decreased protein content, contrasting with the effects observed in plasma-treated milk [32, 34].

CAP, being a non-thermal technology, minimizes heat transfer, thereby preserving heat-sensitive components and nutritional quality [35].  While UHT processing can extend shelf life significantly, it often results in a cooked flavor and greater nutritional losses compared to pasteurization and potentially CAP.  Commercially pasteurized milk, while superior to raw milk in safety and shelf life compared to raw milk, may still undergo some quality degradation that CAP aims to mitigate.

**Limitations and Challenges**

Despite its promise, CAP pasteurization faces certain limitations and challenges.

*   **Process Optimization:** Achieving optimal balance between microbial inactivation and quality preservation requires careful process optimization [13, 36].  Numerous parameters influence CAP effectiveness, and non-optimized processes can lead to quality defects such as lipid oxidation, protein aggregation, and off-flavors [14, 37].
*   **System Complexity and Scalability:** Setting up indirect CAP systems like plasma bubbling can be more complex and demanding compared to direct applications and traditional pasteurization equipment [38, 39]. Scaling up CAP technology for industrial application requires further engineering and development to ensure cost-effectiveness and throughput.
*   **Sensory Properties and Consumer Acceptance:** Direct sensory analysis of CAP-treated cow's milk is limited, and some studies on cheese treated with DBD plasma have indicated flavor reduction and off-odor development [40, 41]. Further research is needed to comprehensively evaluate the sensory impact of CAP on milk and ensure consumer acceptance [42]. Consumer perception regarding safety, health, and environmental impact also plays a crucial role in the adoption of this technology, necessitating clear and accurate communication to address potential concerns [43, 44].
*   **Understanding of Inactivation Mechanisms:**  While CAP's antimicrobial effects are well-documented, the precise mechanisms of microbial inactivation are not fully understood due to the complexity of plasma [45, 46]. Further research is needed to enhance process control and predictability of microbial reduction.
*   **Variability across Setups:** Different CAP setups can significantly impact product quality, indicating a need for standardization to ensure consistent results across various systems and applications [47, 48].

**Industrial Application and Scalability**

Despite the challenges, CAP pasteurization, particularly plasma bubbling, holds significant promise for industrial food applications [49]. The increasing consumer demand for minimally processed, safe, and high-quality dairy products drives the need for innovative technologies like CAP [50, 51].  CAP offers potential for continuous processing and integration into existing milk processing lines.  Furthermore, the extended shelf life achievable through CAP treatment can reduce food waste and improve milk availability. Consumer willingness to purchase plasma-processed milk, provided the price is comparable to conventional milk and clear information about its benefits and safety is available, is a positive indicator for market acceptance [43, 44].

**Future Research Directions**

Future research should focus on:

*   **Sensory Evaluation:** Conducting comprehensive sensory analysis of CAP-treated milk to fully understand its flavor profile and consumer acceptance [52].
*   **Process Optimization:** Further optimizing CAP parameters to minimize quality changes, particularly lipid oxidation and off-flavor development, while maximizing microbial inactivation efficacy [13, 36].
*   **Mechanism Elucidation:**  Deepening the understanding of the precise mechanisms of microbial inactivation and physicochemical changes induced by CAP to enhance process control and predictability [45, 46].
*   **Cost Analysis and Scalability Studies:**  Conducting detailed cost-benefit analyses and scalability studies to evaluate the economic viability and industrial feasibility of CAP pasteurization on a larger scale [49].
*   **Consumer Perception and Education:** Investigating consumer perceptions and developing effective communication strategies to address concerns and promote informed consumer choices regarding CAP-treated milk [44].

**Conclusion**

Cold atmospheric plasma, particularly plasma bubbling, presents a compelling alternative to traditional thermal pasteurization for milk. It demonstrates high efficiency in microbial decontamination and significant potential for extending shelf life while preserving the physicochemical and nutritional qualities of milk more effectively than thermal methods.  While challenges remain in process optimization, system complexity, and sensory aspects, ongoing research and technological advancements are paving the way for industrial adoption.  CAP technology aligns with the growing consumer demand for minimally processed, safe, and nutritious foods, positioning it as a promising pasteurization initiative for the future of the dairy industry.
