# Cold Atmospheric Plasma Research Labs in France: Sterilization and Food Conservation

Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) technology is emerging as a promising tool for sterilization and food conservation, offering an alternative to traditional methods [1]. CAP represents a non-thermal plasma state, characterized by high electron temperatures but near-ambient gas temperatures [2]. Unlike thermal plasmas, where ions and electrons are in equilibrium at extremely high temperatures, CAP operates at lower temperatures, making it suitable for treating heat-sensitive materials like food [2]. This report aims to identify research labs in France that are actively involved in CAP research, specifically focusing on its applications in sterilization and food conservation.

## Background on Cold Atmospheric Plasma

Plasma, often referred to as the fourth state of matter, is a partially or fully ionized gas comprising ions, electrons, neutral particles, and various reactive species [3]. Plasmas can be broadly classified as either equilibrium (thermal or hot) or non-equilibrium (non-thermal or cold), based on the temperature relationship between electrons and heavier particles [3, 4].

### Methods for CAP Generation

CAP can be generated using various methods, including:

*   **Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD):** This method involves applying a high-voltage alternating current across a gap between two electrodes separated by a dielectric material [5]. DBDs are commonly used due to their simplicity and ability to generate large-volume plasmas [5].
*   **Plasma Jet:** Plasma jets produce a stream of reactive species that can be directed onto a surface [5].
*   **Corona Discharge:** This method involves applying high voltage to sharp electrodes [5].
*   **Radiofrequency Discharge (RFD):** RFD is generally produced when a high pulse voltage is applied to a pair of electrodes, one of which is a pin-type corona discharge [2].

These methods allow for the generation of CAP with varying properties and application modalities.

### Mechanisms of Action

CAP exerts its antimicrobial effects through several mechanisms:

*   **Reactive Species:** CAP generates a variety of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), such as hydroxyl radicals (OH), ozone (O3), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and nitric oxide (NO) [6]. These reactive species can damage cellular components, including lipids, proteins, and DNA [6].
*   **UV Radiation:** CAP emits UV radiation, which can also contribute to microbial inactivation by causing genetic damage [6].
*   **Charged Particles:** The presence of charged particles in CAP can disrupt microbial cell membranes, leading to cell death [6].

### Applications of CAP

CAP has a wide range of potential applications, including:

*   **Food Processing and Packaging:** CAP can be used to decontaminate food surfaces and packaging materials, extending shelf life and improving food safety [7].
*   **Medical Sterilization:** CAP can sterilize medical devices and equipment, offering a low-temperature alternative to traditional sterilization methods [8].
*   **Wound Healing:** CAP can promote wound healing by stimulating angiogenesis and enhancing skin cell proliferation [9].
*   **Agriculture:** CAP can modify seed surface properties, improve germination rates, and enhance plant growth [10].

## Applications of CAP in Food Preservation: An Example

While some of the listed research groups focus primarily on medical or environmental applications of CAP, the underlying mechanisms and technologies are often transferable to food preservation. The study "Assessing the Effects of Cold Atmospheric Plasma on the Natural Microbiota and Quality of Pork during Storage" [1] provides a concrete example of CAP's potential in this area.

The study investigated the impact of CAP treatment on pork quality and microbial load during refrigerated storage. The results, summarized in Table 1, demonstrated that CAP treatment can effectively reduce microbial populations on pork, extending its shelf life.

**Table 1: Impact of CAP Treatment on Microbial Levels in Pork During Storage**

| Microorganism        | CAP Treatment Time | Reduction (log CFU/g) |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| TVC (Total Viable Counts) | 3 min              | Up to 1.4             |
| Enterobacteriaceae   | 3 min              | Up to 2.7             |
| Pseudomonas spp.     | 6 & 9 min          | Over 2.0              |

The study also found that CAP treatment can improve water retention in pork and reduce cooking loss, contributing to enhanced product quality [1].

## Challenges and Future Directions

Despite its promise, CAP technology faces several challenges:

*   **Enzyme Inactivation:** CAP cannot fully deactivate enzymes, which can lead to undesirable changes in food quality, such as browning and surface degradation [7].
*   **Color and Texture Changes:** CAP treatment can cause discoloration and softening of fruits and vegetables, affecting consumer acceptance [7].
*   **Lipid Oxidation:** CAP can promote lipid oxidation, leading to rancidity and off-flavors in fatty foods [7].
*   **Regulatory Guidelines:** The absence of clear regulatory guidelines for CAP application in food processing hinders its widespread adoption by the industry [7].

Future research should focus on addressing these challenges by:

*   Optimizing CAP treatment parameters to minimize undesirable quality changes.
*   Developing combined treatment strategies that integrate CAP with other preservation techniques.
*   Establishing clear regulatory guidelines to ensure the safe and effective application of CAP in the food industry.

## Conclusion

Cold atmospheric plasma technology holds great potential for revolutionizing sterilization and food conservation practices. Several research labs in France, including GREMI, LPP, and LPGP, are actively contributing to the advancement of this field. While challenges remain, ongoing research and development efforts are paving the way for the widespread adoption of CAP technology in the food industry, promising safer, higher-quality, and longer-lasting food products. Further investigation into the work of Antoine Rousseau at LPP is warranted. Also, regulatory bodies and their specific guidelines for food packaging based on plasma processes were not found.
